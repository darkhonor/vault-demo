# Terraform Variables. This is an interesting topic. A premise of this demonstration will
# be to show how to store everything that is required in Version Control without exposing
# sensitive values. However, There will be some values that are sensitive and unique to
# your environment that we will need to adjust for your deployment. In those cases, a
# variable file with a `.tfvars.example` will exist with sample data. Save this file without
# the `.example` extension and modify for you use. It will be ignored by this line:
**/sensitive.tfvars
**/sensitive.auto.tfvars
